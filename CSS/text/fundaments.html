      <h3>Tommy the cat</h3>
      <p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago…</p>
      <p>
        Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have
        nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat had met its
        demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome
        prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator — Tommy the cat
        had many a story to tell. But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did.
