# Types of combinators:

Descendant combinator 

- parent child

All the children _descendant_ of the parent (even when there are other elements between the chain) have this rule apply.

Child Combinator

- parent > child

The style rule is only apply if the child is a _direct child_ of the parent (there are no elements between them).


Adjacent sibling

- sibling + sibling

Applys the rules to the second sibling only when it's the _next sibling_ of the first one.

General sibling

- sibling ~ sibling

Applys the rules to the second sibling when it comes _anywhere_ after the first one.
