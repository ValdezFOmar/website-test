/* 
This order is important because link styles build on one another. 
For example, the styles in the first rule will apply to all the 
subsequent ones. When a link is activated, it's usually also 
hovered over. If you put these in the wrong order, and you're 
changing the same properties in each ruleset, things won't work 
as you expect. To remember the order, you could try using a 
mnemonic like LoVe Fears HAte.
